# weather-app

In this project i have implemented many things for the first time that i have recently learned.
such as: MVC, webpack, asynchronous javascript, working with APIs, etc.
And designing is not my strong suit, so I've used my previous design from the Library project.
Have a look: https://iamahmed14.github.io/weather-app/
